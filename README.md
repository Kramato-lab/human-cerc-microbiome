# human-cerc-microbiome
Code for human-primate gut microbiome comparison\
\
Description: These files will allow you to replicate the analyses we used to compare human and non-human primate gut microbiomes. There is a file for 16S rRNA gene amplicon data (16S_code) and a file for shotgun metagenomic data (shotgun_code). Mapping files are also included for each set of analyses, as well as a few custom scripts.
